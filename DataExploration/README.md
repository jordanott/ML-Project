# Data Exploration

### Word Frequency Analysis

Running ```python word_analysis.py``` will produce ```word_frequency.txt```. This holds all words in the forms and their corresponding frequency listed in descending order.

### Word IDs for Embeddings

Using ```word_analysis.load_word_ids()``` will give you all words with a unique ID in a dictionary ```{word : ID}```. This can be used for word embedding.
